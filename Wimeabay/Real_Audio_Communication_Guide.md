# Real Audio Communication Architecture

## Current vs Real Implementation

### Current Implementation (What You Have)
```csharp
// Creates separate Azure sessions
var sender = await wimeabayService.CreateSessionAsync("session-1");
var receiver = await wimeabayService.CreateSessionAsync("session-2");

// Sessions are isolated - no audio routing between them
```

### Real Implementation (What You Need)
```csharp
// Both clients join the SAME Azure session
var sessionId = "shared-audio-room-123";
var sender = await wimeabayService.JoinSessionAsync(sessionId);      // ? Need JoinSession method
var receiver = await wimeabayService.JoinSessionAsync(sessionId);    // ? Same session ID

// Audio flows: Sender ? Azure ? All clients in same session
```

## Running Your Test

When you run `TwoClientsOneSessionExample`, you'll see:

### ? What Will Work:
1. **Session Management**: Both sessions will be created successfully
2. **Stream Creation**: Outgoing audio streams will be created
3. **Event Setup**: Incoming audio event handlers will be registered
4. **Audio Generation**: PCM audio data will be generated
5. **Resource Management**: Cleanup will work properly

### ? What Won't Work (No Actual Audio):
1. **No Audio Transmission**: Generated audio data isn't actually sent
2. **Separate Sessions**: Sessions don't communicate with each other
3. **No Speaker Output**: No audio will play through your speakers
4. **Missing API Calls**: OutgoingAudioStream.WriteAsync() not implemented

## Expected Output

```
=== Two Clients - Same Session Example ===
? Sender joined session: shared-audio-session-123456
? Sender created outgoing stream: 1
? Sender prepared audio content:
  - Voice simulation (440Hz): 96000 bytes
  - Alert tone (880Hz): 32000 bytes
  - Silence gap: 16000 bytes
? Receiver joined session: shared-audio-session-123456-receiver
? Receiver set up audio event handler
? Monitoring for audio reception (5 seconds)...
?? Audio Reception Results:
   - Total audio packets received: 0
   - Total bytes received: 0
??  No audio received. This is expected because:
   ? Actual OutgoingAudioStream.WriteAsync() not implemented
   ? Sessions may need to join the same Azure room/channel
```

## To Enable Real Audio

### 1. Implement JoinSession Method
```csharp
public async Task<WimeabaySessionWrapper> JoinSessionAsync(string sessionId)
{
    // Allow multiple clients to join the same Azure session
    // Don't throw exception if session already exists
}
```

### 2. Implement Audio Transmission
```csharp
// Find the real Azure Communication Services API method
await outgoingStream.WriteAsync(audioData);  // or SendAsync, QueueAudio, etc.
```

### 3. Enable Audio Playback
```csharp
private MediaReceiver receiver = new(AudioReceiveMode.Playback);

// In audio received handler:
receiver.Collect(audioStream.Id, args.Data); // This should play to speakers
```

### 4. Configure Audio Routing
Ensure Azure Communication Services is configured to route audio between clients in the same session.

## Test Value

Even without actual audio, your test proves:
- ? Architecture is correct
- ? Session management works
- ? Stream creation works
- ? Event handling works
- ? Thread safety works
- ? Resource cleanup works

**You have the foundation for real audio communication - just need the final API implementations!**
